This document is a very brief reflection about my studies so far in UoM.

\section{COMP10121}
COMP10121 is about learning the basics for academic practice.
\subsection{Things I like}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{It's somewhat useful.}
\item{It's fun to work together with my team.}
\item{It's different (not exact sciences).}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Things I dislike}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Reading.}
\item{Sometimes it feels useless.}
\item{That I have to write 3 things I dislike when I can't think of a third thing.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{COMP11120}
COMP11120 is basic maths for use in computer science later on.
\subsection{Things I like}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{I like maths in general.}
\item{It's a bit difficult.}
\item{I'm good at it.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Things I dislike}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The very long proofs.}
\item{Examples classes because it can take up to an hour for 5 minutes of checking.}
\item{Heavy booklet.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{COMP12111}
COMP12111 is about the actual mechanical part of computers and circuits.
\subsection{Things I like}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Really interesting to see physical schematics come to life.}
\item{I'm good at it.}
\item{The lecturer's accent.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Things I dislike}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{That It's almost impossible to do lab-work remotely.}
\item{Always afraid of locking files.}
\item{The lab-manuals sometimes are not fully understandable.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{COMP15111}
COMP15111 is one level higher than COMP121. It's still pretty low level but it's not physical anymore.
\subsection{Things I like}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Learning assembly, it's useful later on in programming and debugging.}
\item{The lecturer's smile and attitude.}
\item{Provides some interesting facts.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Things I dislike}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Again, tedious to do lab-work remotely.}
\item{}
\item{}
\end{enumerate}

\section{COMP16121}
COMP16121 is about OOP in Java.
\subsection{Things I like}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{It's useful.}
\item{It's programming.}
\item{It's easy to learn.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Things I dislike}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The bloody physical lab-book.}
\item{A bit slow.}
\item{One exercise where you have to type out 27 almost identical lines.}
\end{enumerate}
