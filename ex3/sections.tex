\section{Bleak House}
London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln’s
Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the
waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it would not be
wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an
elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots,
making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown
snowflakes–gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.
Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better; splashed to their very
blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another’s umbrellas in a general infection of
ill temper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of
other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day
ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those
points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.
Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows;
fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the
waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on
the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on
the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales
of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich
pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the
afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly
pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little ’prentice boy on deck. Chance
people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all
round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds.
Gas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as the sun may,
from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman and ploughboy. Most of
the shops lighted two hours before their time—as the gas seems to know, for it has a
haggard and unwilling look.
