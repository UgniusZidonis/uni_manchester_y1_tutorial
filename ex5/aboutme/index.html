<h1>Who?</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Ugnius. I'm Lithuanian, that's why my name is strange and hard to pronounce. In Lithuanian Ugnius means something simliar to fire boy. But why professor? I got that nickname because I was always explaining school-work or something else to everyone.</p>

<h1>Why CS?</h1>
<p>I was interested in computers since the days I can remember. When I learned how to reinstall Windows on my PC I did that several times a day for 2 weeks until I got tired of not having any permanent files.</p>

<h1>Why UoM?</h1>
<p>I haven't yet understood that myself. Might go to the United States if I get a decent job.</p>

<h1>Freetime?</h1>
<p>Ha... <b>NONE</b>. I work at <a href="https://www.bentley.com/en">Bentley Systems</a> 20hrs/week, I've got plenty enough to do between work and university.</p>

<h1>What do you do at work?</h1>
<p>Currenly I'm an onboarder, which means I'm going through different projects, learning a plethora of skills, languages and techniques. I change projects every 6 months. Currenly working with computer geometries.
<h1>If you have a job, why are you studying?</h1>
<p>Exactly. Social standards?</p>
